Credits to https://gist.github.com/evilmidget38/26d70114b834f71fb3b4 for a part of the code.

# How to use
- Create a new directory and put UnmigratedChecker.jar in it.
- Create a file called 'usernames.txt', containing the usernames you want to check, in the same directory.
- Run UnmigratedChecker.

All unmigrated accounts will be saved to a file called 'output.txt', in the same directory.

NOTE: Due to the Mojang API's rate limit, you can check a maximum of 600,000 usernames per 10 minutes.
